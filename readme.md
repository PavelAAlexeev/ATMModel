## How to run
```sh
dotnet build
dotnet ef database update Â 
dotnet run
```

## Key moments
After entering the correct PIN backend should issue a token with card number and datetime of issue.
Every operation after entering the PIN is checked to correct the token and renew it.
PIN is stored as double SHA256 hash, so nobody knows the PIN.
SQLite is using.
PINs for all users are 0000
Data seeding is in SeedData.Initialize, so you may see card numbers there.  
Everything else is pretty obvious. 

## TODO and need additional efforts
0. The code is literally draft. 
1. Move the token validation to the base model. Now it is copypasted in several places
2. The token now actually is not a token :( , just a card number, lack of time :(
3. Add exception handler - all exceptions are printed on frontend, it's not good.
4. Refactor and refactor.
5. It was my first experience with Razor, honestly, I am sure frontend code is horrible like atomic war.
7. Add tests
